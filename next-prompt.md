Create a high-fidelity **Article Reader Page** for Trendwire.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
# Trendwire - Design System

## Brand DNA
- **Archetype**: The Sage & The Creator.
- **Vibe**: Authoritative, engineered, high-frequency trading terminal.
- **Voice**: "Initialize Growth Engine", "Unlock Pipeline". No fluff.

## Color Palette
- **Background**: `#0b1626` (Deep Navy/Black)
- **Surface**: `#1a2639` (Lighter Navy/Glass)
- **Border**: `#2d3b55` (Subtle Grid)
- **Accent (Primary)**: `#f05a1a` (Electric Orange/Red)
- **Text (Primary)**: `#f8fafc` (White/Slate-50)

## UI Patterns
- **Glassmorphism**: Backdrop blur with thin, translucent borders.
- **Layout**: Centered, readable column (max-w-3xl) with a Sticky Sidebar.
- **Typography**: `JetBrains Mono` for metadata/headers, `Inter` for long-form text (high readability).

**Page Components:**
1.  **Sticky Sidebar (Left)**: Minimal version. Logo (Icon only), Home, Search, Profile.
2.  **Main Article Container**:
    *   **Header**: Large automated "Impact Score" badge (e.g., 9.2). Date/Time stamp (Mono).
    *   **Title**: Huge, bold, authoritative headline. (e.g., "Meta's Advantage+ Algorithm Shift Detected")
    *   **Metadata**: Author, Source (e.g., TechCrunch), Reading Time.
    *   **Body**: Long-form content. Use clear paragraphs, maybe a blockquote style for key insights in Accent color.
    *   **Action Bar**: "Share Brief", "Save to Vault".
3.  **Related Intel (Right/Bottom)**: "Related Signals" list.
4.  **Paywall Overlay (Hidden)**: Same design as Dashboard. Glassmorphic, "Limit Reached", Subscribe button.

**Goal**: A distraction-free, terminal-inspired reading experience. Text should be legible but feel "technical".
